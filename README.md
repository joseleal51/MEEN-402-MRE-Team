# test
This repo is where the code for the Multi-Robot Simulation (MRE) senior design project is stored.

The first part of the project is a python programing structure that reads in settings for a test environment designed by the team. The settings include the number of robots and their associated starting and ending posistions. The settings also include the size of the world and the location of any obsticles.
The python program is to implement well established path planning algorithms and to implement huristics for determining which robot should go first in the even that 2 paths collide. This will be a study tool for demonstrating the effectiveness of these huristics. The objective will be to minimize the make-span or time-span of the traveling robots.

The second part of the project is to demonstrate the environment and robot set-up in Gazebo to show how the robots move from one configuration to the final configuration.
